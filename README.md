Like Ellon Musk, Boston Dynamic, A lot of the new idea and product does not creeated by book worm.

this project I would like to share is a coin sorter. In fact, there has lot of 3D printing on the WEB. But I cannot see any using the Electronic and programming together for the product design. Thus, I use this as my prject core concept.

1) You only need install the Arduino and complied the source which i given,
2) Follow the diagram connected all necessary components then,
3) you may need
