# Arduino-Coin-Sorter
Using Arduino as a control to count the coins.
This is my project for which help a high school students final project. 
After that they will going to University. However, Hong Kong education system is too narrow about the
Academic result, Fast, Precise, Tricking. They need to overcome such nonsense barriers.

this project I would like to share is a coin sorter. In fact, there has lot of 3D printing on the WEB. But I cannot see any using the Electronic and programming together for the product design. Thus, I use this as my prject core concept.

1) You only need install the Arduino and complied the source which i given,
2) Follow the diagram connected all necessary components. however, the program using to create the schematic does not has the correct picture, so the actual snesor outlook maight be variance with the actual one.eq. IR snesor and the I2C LCD 1602
4) you may need some Arduino programming knowledge first before using the Arduino IDE
5) following links can let you learn more about the IR sensor, Motor operation
